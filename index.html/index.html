          <p>Lover is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on August 23, 2019, through Republic Records. As the executive producer, Swift worked with producers Jack Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes and Joel Little on the album. Described by Swift as "a love letter to love itself", the album celebrates the ups and downs of love, incorporating brighter and cheerful tones, departing from the dark sounds of its predecessor, Reputation (2017). The album's cover art and music videos marked a change in Swift's visual appearance, which now embodies a summer aesthetic, consisting mainly of pastel colors. Musically, it is a pop, synth-pop, electropop and pop rock record that contains influences of country, dream pop, bubblegum pop, funk, R&B, pop punk and indie pop.</p>

        <div class="card_about2_homepage">
           <p>Lover features collaborations with the Dixie Chicks and Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco. It was preceded by three singles, all peaking inside the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100; "Me!" and "You Need to Calm Down" peaked at number two, while the title track reached number 10. All 18 tracks of the album charted simultaneously on the Hot 100 chart upon the album's release. The fourth single "The Man" peaked at number 23. The album received positive reviews from critics, who commended Swift's songwriting conveying emotional maturity and honesty. However, a few commentators found the album "lengthy" and "inconsistent" in places. Lover debuted atop the US Billboard 200 chart, moving 867,000 units in its first week. It also debuted at number one in many countries including Australia, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK. Lover was certified double platinum by the RIAA for moving over 2 million units in the US.</p>

To promote the album, Swift is set to embark on the Lover Fest, her sixth concert tour and first music festival tour, beginning on June 20, 2020.
            Lover received a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 62nd Grammy Awards, which is Swift's third consecutive nomination in the category, following 1989 (2014) and Reputation (2017), while its singles "You Need To Calm Down" and "Lover" were nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance and Song of the Year, respectively. The album appeared on numerous year-end best music lists of 2019.</p>
